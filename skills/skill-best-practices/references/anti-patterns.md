# Building Effective Anti-Pattern Sections

## Why Anti-Patterns Are Essential

Half of expert knowledge is knowing what NOT to do. Claude hasn't made those mistakes.
It doesn't know that certain patterns scream "generated by AI" or that specific
approaches silently corrupt data. You must tell it explicitly.

If your skill has no "NEVER" section, it's missing half the expert knowledge.

## Structure of a Good Anti-Pattern

Every anti-pattern needs THREE elements:

1. **The rule**: What to never do (specific, not vague)
2. **The reason**: Why it's bad (concrete consequence)
3. **The alternative**: What to do instead

### BAD: Vague warnings

```markdown
## Considerations
- Avoid making errors
- Be careful with edge cases
- Consider best practices
```

This says nothing. It's noise.

### GOOD: Specific anti-patterns with reasons

```markdown
## NEVER

- **NEVER use generic AI fonts** (Inter, Roboto, Arial)
  -> They reveal automated origin. Use fonts with personality:
  IBM Plex, Source Serif, JetBrains Mono.

- **NEVER apply border-radius to everything by default**
  -> It's the hallmark of lazy UI. Decide consciously: hard edges
  for seriousness, soft rounds for friendliness, pill shapes only
  for tags/badges.

- **NEVER combine more than 2 font families**
  -> Creates visual chaos. One for headings, one for body. Maximum.

- **NEVER use purple gradients on white**
  -> It's the visual cliché of "an AI made this." If you need gradients,
  use tones of a single color or less predictable combinations.
```

## Categories of Anti-Patterns

Structure your NEVER section by category when the skill covers multiple areas:

### Data Integrity Anti-Patterns
```markdown
- **NEVER overwrite the original file** -> Always write to a new file.
  If the process fails midway, the original is preserved.

- **NEVER skip validation after transformation** -> A successful write
  doesn't mean correct content. Always verify the output.
```

### Performance Anti-Patterns
```markdown
- **NEVER load entire file into memory for large files** -> Stream
  processing for files > 100MB. Memory errors are silent killers.

- **NEVER retry failed API calls in a tight loop** -> Use exponential
  backoff. Tight loops trigger rate limits and mask real errors.
```

### UX/Design Anti-Patterns
```markdown
- **NEVER use placeholder text in final output** -> "Lorem ipsum"
  in delivered work is unprofessional. Use realistic sample content.

- **NEVER rely solely on color to convey information** -> ~8% of men
  are colorblind. Always pair color with icons, text, or patterns.
```

## How Many Anti-Patterns?

- **Minimum**: 3-5 per skill (covers critical mistakes)
- **Ideal**: 5-10 per skill (comprehensive without overwhelming)
- **Maximum**: 15 (beyond this, split into categories in a reference file)

## The Generalization Test

A good anti-pattern enables the model to generalize. After reading
"NEVER use purple gradients on white because it screams AI-generated",
the model should also avoid other AI-aesthetic clichés even if not
explicitly listed.

The reason is what enables generalization. Without reasons, anti-patterns
are just arbitrary rules that can't extend to new situations.

## Discovering Anti-Patterns

Ask yourself:

1. What mistakes do beginners always make in this domain?
2. What "works technically" but produces bad results?
3. What common advice is actually wrong or outdated?
4. What silent failures have I encountered?
5. What would make an expert cringe looking at this output?
